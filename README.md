 REdot GAMES
 1.  I have created a Webpage named  REdot GAMES using HTML, CSS, Javascipt and Bootstrap.
 2. This Webpage is mainly focused on Four Things that i have integrated in this Webpage.
 3. There is a 4 Challenges namely : Challenge 1: Your Age in Days
                                     Challenge 2: Gif Generator
                                     Challenge 3: Rock - Paper - Scissors and
                                     Challenge 4: Changing the Color of All Buttons
 4. I have written javascript code for all the Challenges above to work. 
 5. Challenge 1 is not so hard it is just an user Interface In which when user enters there Age, it calculates user's Age in Days.
 6. Challege 2 Gif Generator : This part of challenge returns the user different types of gifs Everytime the user Refreshes the Webpage.
 7. Challenge 3 Rock-paper-scissors : This Challenge allows users to play Rock- paper-scissors game with Bot.
 8. And this Final one Challenge 4: Changing the Color of All Buttons : When user clicks on the button it changes colors of 
 Every single button which is available on that Current Webpage. Choices are : Random, Red color, Green and Reset.

 * In addition to the entry page of the website in which the users can play, there is another page called Action page in 
 which users can view all of the Action games. 
 * I have used HTML, CSS for skeleton of webpage and for styling of webpages. I have used Bootstrap which is a free and open-source 
  CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.It contains CSS and JavaScript-based design 
  templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
 * All of the above Games functions are coded in Javascript. 
 
 I have Done this Webpage to show my work on Front-end Web development and Javascript with which I created a Fully Responsive Webpage.
 
 Thank you.
